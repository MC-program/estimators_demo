# estimators_demo

This is a demo of several estimators. The main module runs a list of them, the winner
will be selected and fed the entire dataset to fit the data well.
Then the validation set can be used to predict unseen output data.
This data is saved under validation_prediction.csv.
A plot to each model is exported to plot.pdf.

### Start with:
Python main.py training.xml validation.xml

training.xml n-dimensional data set for training of models!

validation.xml 1-dimensional target values (co-domain) for just export (and further validation).



### Export files are the following
